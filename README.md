- Churn declines around year 7, then rises again for long-tenure customers

🔹 Churn by Number of Products
- Customers with only one product have the highest churn rate
- Churn decreases as product count increases → clear cross-selling opportunity

- Highest churn observed in 31–45 and 46–60 age segments
- Lower churn among younger (18–30) and senior (60+) customers

🔹 Financial Behavior
